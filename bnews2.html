        <p> In a live-address to the nation, 69-year-old Mr. Khan also discussed a ‘threat letter’ that purportedly showed “evidence” of a foreign conspiracy to topple his coalition government. He named the US as the country behind the threat in what appeared to be a slip of tongue.

            “...Our policy was not anti-US, -Europe, or even India [...] it became anti-Indian after New Delhi revoked the special status of Kashmir and broke international law in August 2019,” said Khan, who insists that the Kashmir dispute remained a big issue between the two countries.
            
            India has repeatedly told Pakistan that Jammu and Kashmir “was, is and shall forever” remain an integral part of the country. “...the letter stated that the no-confidence motion was being tabled even before it was filed, which means the Opposition was in contact with them,” Khan said, adding that the letter was against him, not against the government.
             Mr. Khan said he will play till the last ball and the no-trust vote on Sunday will decide where the country will go.
    
        Mr. Khan needs 172 votes in the lower house of 342 to foil the Opposition's bid to topple him. However, Opposition claims it has the support of 175 lawmakers and the prime minister should immediately resign.
        
        No Pakistani Prime Minister has ever completed a full five-year term in office. Also, no prime minister in Pakistan’s history has ever been ousted through a no-confidence motion, and Khan is the third premier to face the challenge.

Mr. Khan said that it was an “official letter” that was communicated to Pakistan’s ambassador, who was taking notes during the meeting.
